# .agent/ Directory

This directory contains resources to assist AI agents and developers in maintaining high production standards.

## Structure

- **`/workflows`**: Step-by-step guides for common processes (e.g., Deploy, Bug Fix).
- **`/skills`**: Knowledge base for specific technologies (React, Python, AWS).
- **`/templates`**: Reusable code snippets and boilerplates.
- **`/prompts`**: specialized prompts to set AI behavior.
- **`/context`**: Project-specific rules, style guides, and architecture docs.

## Usage
When starting a task, look for a relevant **Workflow**. If you need to write code in a specific language, consult the **Skills** folder for best practices. Use **Templates** to bootstrap files quickly.
