# iOS Swift Skills

## Modern SwiftUI
- **Declarative UI**: Use SwiftUI for new projects.
- **State Management**: `@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservedObject`, `@EnvironmentObject`.

## Architectures
- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel (Standard for SwiftUI).
- **TCA**: The Composable Architecture (For complex state).

## Best Practices
- **Strict Typing**: Leverage Swift's type system.
- **Protocols**: Use Protocol Oriented Programming (POP).
- **Optional Binding**: Use `if let` or `guard let` safely.
- **ARC**: Watch out for strong reference cycles (use `weak self` in closures).

## Dependencies
- Use **Swift Package Manager (SPM)** over CocoaPods.
