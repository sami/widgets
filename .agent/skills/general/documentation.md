# Documentation Skills

## Types
1.  **README**: Entry point. What, Why, How to Start.
2.  **API Docs**: Endpoints, parameters, responses (Swagger/OpenAPI).
3.  **Architecture**: Deployment diagrams, C4 models.
4.  **Code Comments**: Explain *complex* logic (Why), not obvious syntax (What).

## Principles
- **Keep it Updated**: Outdated docs are worse than no docs.
- **Know your Audience**: User vs Developer vs Executive.
- **Examples**: People learn by copy-pasting code.

## Tools
- **Docusaurus**: Static site generator.
- **Sphinx**: Python docs.
- **FSD** (Feature Sliced Design): Documentation structure.
