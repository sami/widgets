# Prompt Engineering Skills

## Principles
1.  **Clarity**: Be specific. "Write code" vs "Write a Python function to parse CSV".
2.  **Context**: Provide background info, constraints, and format requirements.
3.  **Persona**: "Act as a Senior React Engineer".
4.  **Examples (Few-Shot)**: Show 1-3 inputs and expected outputs.

## Structure
- **Role**: Who is the AI?
- **Task**: What needs to be done?
- **Constraints**: What to avoid? (e.g., "No external libraries").
- **Output Format**: JSON, Markdown, Code only.

## Techniques
- **Chain of Thought**: Ask the AI to "Think step by step".
- **Refinement**: Iterate on the output. "Make it more concise".
- **Parameters**: Adjust Temperature (Lower = more deterministic, Higher = creative).
