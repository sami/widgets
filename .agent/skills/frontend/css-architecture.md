# CSS Architecture

## Methodologies

### BEM (Block Element Modifier)
Naming convention for classes to prevent conflicts.
- `.block`
- `.block__element`
- `.block--modifier`

### Utility-First (Tailwind CSS)
Compose designs using small, single-purpose classes.
- Advantages: Rapid development, consistency, smaller bundle size.

### CSS Modules
Scoped CSS automatically generated by build tools.

## Best Practices
1.  **Mobile First**: Write styles for mobile screens first, then use media queries for larger screens.
2.  **Variables/Custom Properties**: Use CSS variables for colors, spacing, and fonts.
3.  **Reset/Normalize**: Ensure consistent browser rendering.
4.  **Avoid `!important`**: It breaks the cascade and makes overriding difficult.

## Directory Structure (SASS/SCSS example)
```text
styles/
├── base/       # Reset, typography
├── components/ # Buttons, cards
├── layout/     # Grid, header, footer
├── utils/      # Variables, mixins
└── main.scss   # Imports all
```
